# Flexible Survival Resources
This repository contains extra resources for coding Flexible Survival

## VSCode Snippets
Installation instructions:
1: Place the wanted .json file in `%AppData%\Code\User\snippets` (merge or replace files if needed)
2: Ensure VSCode setting `editor.tabCompletion` is set to `onlySnippets` or `on`

Usage instructions:
1: Type the snippet prefix - i.e. `situation` - where you're wanting to insert the snippet
2: As you're typing, the snippet should eventually appear in the context menu. Once you've found it, hit tab on your keyboard to insert the snippet

Once the snippet is inserted, your cursor will be automatically moved to preset tabstops, sometimes selecting predefined text. Hitting tab again will move you to the next tabstop, until the snippet is finished. You can cancel this at any time by hitting escape, or manually moving the cursor.

Feel free to offer suggestions for snippets to add.
